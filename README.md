# Advent of Code 2023

The repo where I will dump all my solutions to AOC 2023.

## Language(s)

This year I plan on completing all the tasks in Haskell. Going
into to I would say I'm only slightly beyond "Hello World!" level
though I did write an ultra slow JSON like parser at one point.

I also plan on completing some tasks in C as well. I want to test
if I can write something in Haskell that will outperform a trivial
solution in C. My prior experience has taught me otherwise but I'm
hoping to be surprised.

## Documentation

The README associated with each day will contain any performance
testing I have done. I plan on including the problem statement as
a comment in the code and any thoughts on implementation or other
issues will be included in the commit messages.

## Happy Hacking and Holidays!
